# How to use these debug practice problems
- Read the problem statement
- Read the introduction and the code
- Find a test case where the code fails, as fast as you can
- Explain exactly why the code/idea fails on that case
- Fix the code by changing it as little as possible (sometimes not possible)
- Check that after the fix, it works on the test case you created
- Submit and get AC
